# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Predicts Titanic Passenger Survival (Naive Bayes)

This Python code predicts survivors of the 1912 Titanic disaster using passenger data from Kaggle. It leverages machine learning techniques, likely focusing on Naive Bayes algorithms, to analyze factors influencing survival rates. The code aims to identify patterns in the data and build a model capable of predicting survival outcomes for new passengers.
